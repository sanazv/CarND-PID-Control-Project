Reflections of the impact of each of the parameters:
Each of the three P, I and D parameters are responsible to correct for the path of the car in a was that the cross track error (CTE) is minimized. Starting with P, the proportional term: if P is too large the corrections towards the goal path become too strong and the car not only reaches the desired position but also overshoots beyond it and increasing the cross track error again but on the other side. With a P value too low, the correction doesn’t happen fast enough and the car can miss a turn. 

We can damp the unwanted impact of the medium P, by looking at the rate of change of the CTE as a function of time and tweeting the D parameter. If the change is too large, as is the car is correcting too sharply, the damping term can reduce the impact and stop the car from oscillating too much one way or the other. If D parameter is too strong, the dampening effect takes over and provides too much resistance when P is aiming to move to the direction of reducing the CTE error. This may appear as if a scared and super conservative driver is driving the car.
On the other hand, a too low D value also doesn’t reach the goal of controlling the oscillations brought by P.
The I term is more about correcting for systematic error of the vehicle alignment. If such systematic error exists, over time there will be a persistent positive or negative bias. The I term aims to correct for this.

I chose to use the manual tuning method rather than twiddle mainly to gain intuition about the impact of each of the elements of control. Also twiddle is effectively automated trial and error, so I took the same approach but manually. Starting with some base values and increase and decrease each so that the behaviour of the car became more desirable. I also used the lecture videos as inspiration on what to set the values to.
